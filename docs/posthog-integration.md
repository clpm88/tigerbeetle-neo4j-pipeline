# PostHog Integration Plan

## Overview

PostHog is a product analytics platform that provides user behavior tracking, feature flags, A/B testing, and session replay. For our TigerBeetle Neo4j pipeline, PostHog will be valuable when we implement the v2 web UI.

## Free Tier Benefits

Based on PostHog's pricing page, the free tier includes:
- 1M events per month
- 5K session recordings per month  
- 1M feature flag requests per month
- Unlimited team members
- 1 project with 1-year data retention
- Community support

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Now)
- [ ] Create PostHog Cloud account
- [ ] Set up project configuration
- [ ] Document PostHog API keys in environment setup

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (v2 Implementation)
- [ ] Add PostHog JavaScript SDK to e-commerce web UI
- [ ] Track key user events:
  - Account registration
  - Login/logout
  - Product views
  - Add to cart
  - Purchase attempts
  - Purchase completions
  - Payment failures

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Future)
- [ ] Custom event tracking for business metrics
- [ ] Funnel analysis (registration → first purchase)
- [ ] Cohort analysis (user retention)
- [ ] A/B testing for UI features
- [ ] Feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Variables
```bash
POSTHOG_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.posthog.com  # or EU: https://eu.posthog.com
```

### Frontend Integration (React/Vue Example)
```javascript
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

// Initialize PostHog
posthog.init('YOUR_API_KEY', {
    api_host: 'https://us.posthog.com'
})

// Track events
posthog.capture('purchase_completed', {
    transaction_id: transfer.id,
    amount: transfer.amount,
    from_account: transfer.debit_account_id,
    to_account: transfer.credit_account_id
})
```

### Backend Integration (Go)
```go
import "github.com/posthog/posthog-go"

client := posthog.New("YOUR_API_KEY")
defer client.Close()

client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: userId,
    Event:      "transaction_processed",
    Properties: map[string]interface{}{
        "amount":           amount,
        "transaction_type": "transfer",
        "processing_time":  duration.Milliseconds(),
    },
})
```

## Analytics Use Cases

### User Behavior Analytics
- **Registration funnel**: Track where users drop off during signup
- **Purchase behavior**: Most popular products, cart abandonment
- **User journey**: Path from registration to first purchase
- **Session analysis**: Time spent, pages viewed

### Business Intelligence
- **Revenue tracking**: Correlate PostHog events with TigerBeetle transactions
- **Conversion rates**: Registration → purchase conversion
- **Feature adoption**: Which features are most used
- **Performance impact**: How UI changes affect user behavior

### Integration with Existing Pipeline
- **Event correlation**: Match PostHog user events with TigerBeetle transaction IDs
- **Real-time dashboards**: Combine PostHog metrics with Prometheus/Grafana
- **Fraud detection**: Unusual user behavior patterns
- **Neo4j enhancement**: Add user behavior data to graph analysis

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate (Setup Phase)**
   - Create PostHog account
   - Add environment configuration
   - Test basic API connectivity

2. **V2 Launch (Frontend Integration)**
   - Add PostHog SDK to web UI
   - Implement core event tracking
   - Set up basic dashboards

3. **Post-V2 (Advanced Features)**
   - Custom properties and user profiles
   - A/B testing implementation
   - Advanced funnel analysis
   - Integration with Neo4j user graph

## Data Privacy Considerations

- **GDPR compliance**: PostHog provides EU hosting and GDPR tools
- **User consent**: Implement proper consent banners
- **Data retention**: Configure appropriate retention periods
- **PII handling**: Avoid sending sensitive data like credit card numbers

## Next Steps

1. Create PostHog account and get API keys
2. Add PostHog configuration to `.env` file (remember to add to .gitignore)
3. Document PostHog setup in main README
4. Plan specific events to track for v2 implementation
